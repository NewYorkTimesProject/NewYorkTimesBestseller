# New York Times Bestseller Project

The New York Times newspaper has published “best seller” lists since 1942.  Book sales are tracked nationwide, leading to a list of those books which have recently sold the most copies. The file bestsellers2.txt contains books which have reached #1 on either of two lists (fiction and nonfiction) since 1942. This file is the data set for the code we have created. We have chosen this project from the python projects that were offered to us. Our code only works in python. This code enables the user to search for title and author in the data set. Furthermore, the user can search for books in a specific month and year and let the code display all books in a year range. At the beginning a menu is displayed to the user where he can choose between these four functions. When the user is finished with searching through the data set, he also has the option to quit, which will end the running of the code. Our code is corrected for different potential input mistakes and returns appropriate error messages in those cases so the user can revise the input again. Due to the original formatting of the bestsellers2.txt file the titles, names of authors and publishers are displayed without spaces between two words or names.
